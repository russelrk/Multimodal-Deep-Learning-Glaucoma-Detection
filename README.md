# Multimodal Glaucoma Detection

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the development and optimization of machine learning models for the early and accurate detection of glaucoma using a multimodal approach. Our methodology leverages data from various sources including Color Fundus Photography (CFP), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), and clinical datasets.

## Project Structure

The repository comprises four primary segments, each focusing on a distinct data modality, followed by a final model that integrates the insights derived from each segment. The details of each segment are as follows:

### 1. CFP Models
- **Description**: Developing machine learning models using Color Fundus Photography data to aid in glaucoma detection.


### 2. OCT Models
- **Description**: Utilizing Optical Coherence Tomography data to build predictive models for identifying potential glaucoma cases.


### 3. Clinical Data Models
- **Description**: Leveraging clinical datasets to construct models that incorporate a range of metrics and parameters for glaucoma identification.


### 4. Final Model
- **Description**: The culmination of the project, where the insights and predictions from the individual models are converged to develop a comprehensive glaucoma detection solution.
